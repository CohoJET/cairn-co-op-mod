## What is this?

An attempt to add multiplayer to Cairn. 

## The Problem

Cairn uses **IL2CPP**. Modding IL2CPP games is pain.

## Current Status

This repo is a placeholder. It will either be updated with a working mod or deleted entirely when I inevitably fail.

Aava reached the summit. Currently, this is my summit.
